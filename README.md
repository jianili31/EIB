# Emotional Experience in the Brain
Honors thesis project about neural synchrony and emotional experience: https://psyarxiv.com/4h9eu/

## Motivation
We have emotional experience everyday. Yet, due to its private nature, emotional experience has been notoriously hard to study scientifically. However, instead of finding neurobiological mechanisms for the *content* of emotional experience, what if we search for neural correlates of *interpersonal similarity* in emotional experience? This is exactly the rationale behind the Representational Similarity Analysis: if a neural region is indeed involved in a psychological process, then it should represent interpersonal similarity in this process in the same way as other measures (e.g., self-report). Thus, the current study aimed to find neural regions where interpersonal synchronization of neural activity tracks interpersonal similarity in self-reported emotional experience.

## Interpersonal Neural & Behavioral Dissimilarity
Interpersonal similarity in neural activity is commonly operationalized as the correlation between two people's neural timeseries. Because in the current study, we applied the same RSA analysis on emotion ratings as well, which only consisted of 3 items, it didn't make sense to do correlation. So, we instead measured *interpersonal dissimilarity* in neural activity and emotion ratings using Euclidean distances. 

## Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy
Another problem with assessing emotional experience is the selection of neuroimaging modality. fMRI is the most popular modality in affective neuroscience. Yet, it creates a highly artificial environment (e.g., noise, having to limit body movement) that does not mirror how we experience emotions in everyday life. EEG allows for greater mobility, but it lacks the appropriate spatial resolution to determine neural regions involved in emotional experience. One beautiful middle ground is 
Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), which is a portable, noninvasive neuroimaging technique that affords enough spatial and temporal resolutions for us to examine neural activity during naturalistic emotional experience. 

## Methods
We recruited 104 subjects in the UCLA community. We created 4 political videos that featured speakers arguing about gun control (2 for, 2 against), and had subjects watch them while being scanned by fNIRS. They also rated their emotional experience afterwards. 

## Results
For details about statistical analyses and numerical results, please refer to the preprint (linked above). Overall, we found that neural synchrony in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) tracked interpersonal similarity in negative, but not positive, emotional experience. The study has several implications:
1. mPFC and emotions: mPFC has been implicated in higher-order emotion processing (e.g., emotion regulation). So in this study, subjects may have been prompted to regulate their aversive emotional experience.
2. mPFC as a node of the Default Mode Network: the DMN is a collection of regions often implicated in self-referential processing and mentalizing (e.g., thinking about one's own beliefs and mental states, inferring other people's mental states). So, when subjects experienced unpleasant emotions, they may have been motivated to reflect on their own or the speakers' beliefs.
3. Negative emotions might be experienced more homogenously than the positive ones. More studies need to be done to confirm this.
4. The study confirmed that combining neural synchrony + portable neuroimaging + a naturalistic paradigm is an ecologically valid approach to studying emotional experience.
